A sane man&#39;s guide to privacy hopes to keep you private without losing all your friends in the process
modern day technology can be very privacy invasive, smart home technology, especially apps like youtube and tiktok, tiktok has already had many huge issues such as straight up <a href="https://youtu.be/Ti8v4eL8oIE">grabbing clipboard data from users</a> (effectively keylogging users for nefarious reasons)</p>
<p>This blog intends to prevent your very important data to yourself, now you may ask</p>
<p>&quot;I have nothing to hide&quot;</p>
<p>Short answer: 
Even if you&#39;re the most boring and normal guy, your data can still end up in the wrong hands.</p>
<details> <summary> Long answer: </summary>

Well firstly I&#39;d like to remind you that these technologies can track what you watch, what you like, what you eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/5iIg7wmEz20">Google knows you better than your own mother</a> not to mention advertising companies can quite literally shape your life and not always in a good way, it can lead you to many fucked up rabbit holes such as the deep deep alt-right which is straight up racism, by using many mainstream technology you are effectively leaving your front door open but to your mind and life

Still seems fine as you&#39;re just a normal law abiding citizen? you <a href="https://youtu.be/CE0EB5bXj14">still have a chance</a> of getting your dick chopped, do you really want a bunch of people who wanna make money off of you to have a full view of your personal life?

And some third world countries can end up literally arresting for being homosexual or transgender, there&#39;s many videos defending privacy and I think you should check them out if you&#39;re still skeptical
