Well firstly I'd like to remind you that these technologies can track what you watch, what you like, what you eat. [Google knows you better than your own mother](https://youtu.be/5iIg7wmEz20) not to mention advertising companies can quite literally shape your life and not always in a good way, it can lead you to many fucked up rabbit holes such as the deep deep alt-right which is straight up racism, by using many mainstream technology you are effectively leaving your front door open but to your mind and life

Still seems fine as you're just a normal law abiding citizen? you [still have a chance](https://youtu.be/CE0EB5bXj14) of getting your dick chopped, do you really want a bunch of people who wanna make money off of you to have a full view of your personal life?
